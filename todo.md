## In-Progress for Upcoming Release (v2.0.0)

- Add support for multiple file types.
- Reject time windows based on LTA, STA in the time domain.
- Reject time windows based on maximum amplitude in the time domain.
- Include orientation of horizontal components relative to north in metadata.
- Add function to rotate station to true north.
- Add RotD50
- Separate development packages from production packages.
- Automatic consideration of multiple peaks.
- You could use effective amplitude spectrum (EAS) measure (sqrt(Â½(FASH1^2+FASH2^2))) which is a common metric for ground motion modelling in FAS domain, and it is rotation independent. 

## Under Consideration for a Future Release
