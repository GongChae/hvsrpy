    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "`hvsrpy` is a Python module for performing horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H/V) calculations.\n",
    "This notebook and `hvsrpy` were developed by Joseph P. Vantassel with contributions from Dana Brannon under the supervision of Professor Brady R. Cox at the University of Texas at Austin.\n",
    "The automated frequency-domain rejection algorithm implemented in `hvsrpy` was developed by Tianjian Cheng under the supervision of Professor Brady R. Cox at the Univesity of Texas at Austin and detailed in Cheng et al. (in review). \n",
    "This notebook is intended as a simplified interface to `hvsrpy` to allow a user to perform H/V processing without the need to write any additional code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "1. Follow the provided instructions to install _hvsrpy_ and its dependencies. __(~30 minutes)__\n",
    "2. Try analyzing the four provided example files. The names of these files have been written and commented out in the section _Time Domain Settings_ for your conveinience. __(~30 minutes)__\n",
    "3. Try one of your own _miniseed_ files and confirm that the result from _hvsrpy_ matches that of Geopsy. Note that Geopsy does not perform any bandpass filtering. If you get an error related to the _miniseed_ file this likely means it does\n",
    "not conform to the _SEED_ standard (refer to _hvsrpy_ documentation for details), if the problem persists please send a copy of the file along with the error message to (jvantassel@utexas.edu). __(~15 minutes)__\n",
