    "\n",
    "_hvsrpy_ is an open-source Python package for performing horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) processing of microtremor and earthquake recordings. _hvsrpy_ was developed by [Jospeh P. Vantassel](https://www.jpvantassel.com/) with contributions from Dana M. Brannon under the supervision of Professor Brady R. Cox at The University of Texas at Austin. _hvsrpy_ continues to be developed and maintained by [Joseph P. Vantassel and his research group at Virginia Tech](https://geoimaging-research.org/).\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates how _hvsrpy_ offers different methods for smoothing the horizontal and vertical Fourier spectrums\n",
    "and the effect it can have on the HVSR curve. The microtremor data presented are from Cox and Vantassel (2018).\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install _hvsrpy_, with `pip install hvsrpy`. If you are not familiar with _pip_, a useful tutorial can be found [here](https://jpvantassel.github.io/python3-course/#/intro/pip). __(~3 minutes)__\n",
    "2. Try analyzing the three provided examples. The names of these files have been written and commented out in the section _Time Domain Settings_ for your convenience. __(~15 minutes)__\n",
    "3. Try one of your own _miniSEED_ (or other accepted format) files by changing the input file names below.  __(~15 minutes)__\n",
