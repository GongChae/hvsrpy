hvsrpy Documentation
====================

`hvsrpy` is a Python package for horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio
processing. It includes four main class definitions `Sensor3c`, `Hvsr`,
`HvsrRotated`, and `HvsrVault`. These classes include various methods for
creating and manipulating 3-component sensor and horizontal-to-vertical
spectral ratio objects.

This package and the classes therein are actively being developed, so if you
do not see a feature you would like it may very well be under development and
released in the near future. To be notified of future releases, you can either
``watch`` the repository on
`Github <https://github.com/jpvantassel/hvsrpy>`_ or
``Subscribe to releases`` on the
`Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/project/hvsrpy/>`_.
