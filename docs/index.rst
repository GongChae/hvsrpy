hvsrpy Documentation
====================

Summary
-------
hvsrpy is a Python module for horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio
processing. hvsrpy was developed by Joseph P. Vantassel with contributions
from Dana M. Brannon under the supervision of Professor Brady R. Cox at the
University of Texas at Austin. The fully-automated frequency-domain rejection
algorithm implemented in `hvsrpy` was developed by Tianjian Cheng under the
supervision of Professor Brady R. Cox at the University of Texas at Austin and
detailed in Cox et al. (in review).

The module includes two main class definitons `Sensor3c` and `Hvsr`. These
classes include various methods for creating and manipulating 3-component
sensor and horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio objects, respectively.
